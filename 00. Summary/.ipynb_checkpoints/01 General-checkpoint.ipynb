    "*means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects*  \n",

    "* contains variables and methods\n",
    "* collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data\n",
    "* an instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects\n",
    "* used to model and represent real-world entities and concepts in a program.\n",
    "* Object Oriented Design focuses on \n",
    "    * *Encapsulation*: packing of data and functions operating on that data into a single component and restricting the access to some of the objectâ€™s components.\n",
    "    * *Inheritance*: allows defining a class (child class) that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.\n",
    "    * *Polymorphism*: allows defining new methods in the child class with the same name as defined in their parent class (well... its much more complex than that, but enough for our use cases).\n",

    "* **Instances of Classes**\n",
    "    * Objects are instances of classes\n",
    "    * A class defines the behavior and structure of objects, <br> including what data attributes they have and what methods can be called on them.\n",
    "* **Attributes**\n",
    "    * Objects have attributes, which are data stored within the object.\n",
    "    * These attributes can be accessed and modified using dot notation (object.attribute).\n",
    "    * Attributes can be variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, or any other data type.\n",
    "* **Methods**\n",
    "    * Objects can have methods, which are functions that operate on the object's data.\n",
    "    * Methods are defined within the class and can be called on the object using dot notation (object.method()).\n",
    "* **Identity**\n",
    "    * Each object in Python has a unique identity, which can be obtained using the id() function.\n",
    "    * This identity is guaranteed to be unique and constant for the lifetime of the object.\n",
    "* **Type**\n",
    "    * Every object in Python has a type, which specifies the class of the object.\n",
    "    * The type of an object can be obtained using the type() function.\n",
    "* **Dynamic Nature**\n",
    "    * Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that the type of an object is determined at runtime and can change during the execution of the program.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Class\n",

    "* A *class* is a special data type which defines how to build a certain kind of object which may contain *variables* and *methods*.\n",
    "* *Objects* are instances of a *class* that are created following the definition given inside of the class."
